# Hodlinfo Clone - QuadB Node.js Assignment

This project is a clone of the **[hodlinfo.com](https://hodlinfo.com/)** webpage. It is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **SQLite**, and fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from the **WazirX API**. The website dynamically displays the best prices for trading cryptocurrencies across multiple platforms, resembling the original website in terms of both functionality and design.

## Features

- **Real-time Cryptocurrency Data**: Fetches the top 10 cryptocurrency data from the [WazirX API](https://api.wazirx.com/api/v2/tickers).
- **SQLite Database**: Stores cryptocurrency data like `name`, `last traded price`, `buy`, `sell`, `volume`, and `base unit`.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Updates data on the front end without needing a page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Dark Theme**: Follows a dark theme similar to the original hodlinfo website.
- **Auto-Update Data**: Fetches new data every few minutes to ensure accurate, up-to-date information.
